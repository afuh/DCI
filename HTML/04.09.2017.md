### What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML describes the structure of web pages using markup
- HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and represented by <tags>

### HTML elements and tags
An HTML page is build of elements, that are represented by tags. A tag is a keyword (defined by the
language) surrounded by a less than and a greater than sign.
Tags should be written in lowercase letters, even if the browser will accept uppercase letters. The lowercase
version is the de facto standard.
### A basic HTML page layout
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en-US">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Top level heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph with text</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
### What is the `<header>` used for?
The header element contains meta information like the page title (used as the browser window title), the
charset, stylesheets to load, etc.
### What is the <body> used for?
The body element contains the visible codes of a web page. 6. HTML headings
Headings are used to write semantic structured text. There are 6 levels of headings you can use in HTML. Browsers will, by default, use different font-sizes for headlines (h1 = large, h6 = small)

```html
<h1>This is a top level heading </h1>
<h2>This is a second level heading</h2>
```

### HTML paragraphs
Paragraphs are used to structure text in blocks and each paragraph will, as a browser default, have an empty space (1 line of the font size high) below.
```html
<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```
### HTML links
Links are used to reference other web pages or special elements of a web page.
An external link to another web page looks like this:
```html
<a href="https://www.digitalcareerinstitute.org">Digital Career Institute</a>
```
The `<href>` attribute references the target and the text between the opening and closing tag will be shown as linktext in the browser. With an optional `target` attribute, it’s possible to tell the browser to always load the link target as new tab / window (which is defined by a user setting).
```html
<a href="https://www.digitalcareerinstitute.org" target ="_blank">DCI</a>
```
Internal links reference special elements (with an attribute ID, or anchor tags) in a web page.
```html
<a name ="first-section"></a> <!-- defines an anchor -->
<a href ="#first-section">Go to first section</a> <!-- references an anchor -->
```

### HTML images
Images can be used as local files with a relative path, as URL or as inline data.
The attributes `width` and `height` specify the image dimensions (which can be different than the original image size).
```html
<img src="./images/local-file.jpg" width="100" height="100">
<img src="https://your-domain.com/images/url-file.jpg" width="100" height="100">
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4RiDRxhpZgAA..." width="100" height="100">
```
Every image should have an `alt` attribute, which specifies the alternate text used for screen readers and if the image can’t be displayed (because it’s missing on the server, etc.).

```html
<img src="./images/local-file.jpg" alt="Digital Career Institute Logo">
```
An optional `title` attribute can be used to specify a text that’s shown in a tooltip, when the user hovers the mouse over the image. This is especially useful for icons and other user interface items, that might use images.
```html
<img src="./images/edit-icon.png" title="Edit">
```

### Icon Fonts

Icon fonts are used instead of graphics, as they are more flexible, scalable and very easy to use.
The also define some kind of "standard" icons that get used for the same thing on many pages.

The most famous icon font is called [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and it is used on millions of web pages all over the world.
It's free to use and offers almost every icon you might need for web development.


### Background

- The `background-image` property sets one or more background images on an element.

- The `background-repeat` property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all.

- The `background-position` property sets the initial position for each defined background image. By default, background images are positioned at the left top corner of an element.

- The `background-size` property specifies the size of the background images. The size of the image can be fully constrained or only partially in order to preserve its intrinsic ratio.

  - The `cover` keyword value specifies that the background image will be resized to completely cover an element’s width and height.
  The background image’s original aspect ratio will be preserved, yet the image will stretch or shrink as necessary to cover the entire element.

  - The `contain` keyword value, on the other hand, specifies that the background image will be resized to reside entirely contained within an element’s width and height. In doing so the background image’s original aspect ratio will be preserved, but the image will stretch or shrink as necessary to remain within the width and height of the element.

- The CSS `background` shorthand property lets you adjust all of the available background style options at once.

#### Background gradient

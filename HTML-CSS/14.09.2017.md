## Forms
#### Initializing a form

The `<form>` element wraps all of the elements that build the form (input fields, buttons, etc.). The most important attributes are `action` and `method`.

The attribute `action` tells the browser which URL to open, when the form is send.

The attribute `method` defines the [HTTP Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). Most used and supported by all browsers are `GET` and `POST`.

If you set the `method` to `GET`, the form data will be send as parameters of the URL that the form redirects to. The parameter values are [URL-encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/).
This method can be useful for search forms, so that users can bookmark the search URL.

Example:

`http://your-music-website.com/?artist=madonna&title=like%20a%20prayer`

If you set it to `POST` the form data will be send invisible inside the request and can be read by all back-end languages.

#### Text fields
One of the most used elements to obtain text from users is the `<input>` element.

The `type` attribute defines what type of information is to be captured within the control.

The `name` attribute defines the name of the parameter that is send as form data.

```html
<input type="text" name="name" id="name">
```
The available types are as follows:
color, date, datetime, email, month, number, range, search, tel, time, url, week

But... not all browser support all types for now and the results might look very different.

#### Text areas
Textareas are used if longer text input is needed. The difference between `input` elements with `type="text"` and `textarea` is that there can be line breaks in a `textarea`, which is especially useful for blog articles and other large texts.

```html
<textarea name="about_me" id="about_me"></textarea>
```

#### Multiple Choice Inputs & Menus
Radio buttons are an easy way to allow users to make a quick choice from a small list of options. Radio buttons permit users to select one option only.

The radio input field needs a new attribute value as the user is not giving text into an input field but selects a pre-defined value.

If a value should be checked by default (when the page is loaded) we can add the attribute checked without a value.

```html
<input
  type="radio"
  name="favorite_language"
  value="English"
  id="favorite_language_en"
  checked>
<label for="favorite_language_en">English</label>

<input
  type="radio"
  name="favorite_language"
  value="German"
  id="favorite_language_en"
  checked>
<label for="favorite_language_en">German</label>
```
#### Checkboxes

Check boxes are very similar to radio buttons. They use the same attributes and patterns, with the exception of `checkbox` as their `type` attribute value. The difference between the two is that check boxes allow users to select multiple values and tie them all to one control name

```html
<input type="checkbox"
  name="favorite_continent[]"
  value="Africa"
  id="favorite_continent_af" checked>
<label for="favorite_continent_af">Africa</label>

<input type="checkbox"
  name="favorite_continent[]"
  value="Asia"
  id="favorite_continent_af">
<label for="favorite_continent_af">Asia</label>
```

#### Drop-Down Lists
Drop-down lists are a perfect way to provide users with a long list of options in a practical manner. To create a drop-down list we’ll use the `<select>` and `<option>` elements.

The `<select>` element wraps all of the menu options, and each menu option is marked up using the `<option>` element.

Each `<option>` element has a `value` attribute and the element that gets selected by the user will be send as `value` for the parameter you defined by setting the `name` attribute of the `<select>` element.

If you want an `<option>` element to be selected when the page loads, you can add
the selected attribute without any value.

```html
<label for="weekday">The current weekday:</label>

<select name="weekday" id="weekday">
    <option value="Monday">Monday</option>
    <option value="Tuesday">Tuesday</option>
    <option value="Wednesday">Wednesday</option>
    <option value="Thursday">Thursday</option>
    <option value="Friday">Friday</option>
    <option value="Saturday">Saturday</option>
    <option value="Sunday">Sunday</option>
</select>
```

#### Form buttons

After a user inputs the requested information, buttons allow the user to put that information into action. Most commonly, a submit input or submit button is used to process the data.

##### Submit Input

Users click the submit button to process data after filling out a form. The submit button can be created using the `<input>` element with a type attribute value of submit. The value attribute is used to specify the text that appears within the button.

```html
<input type="submit" class="btn btn-submit" value="Send my form">
```

##### Submit Button

By default, the `<button>` element acts as if it has a `type` attribute value of `submit`, so the `type` attribute and `value` may be omitted from the element if you wish.

```html
<button class="btn btn-submit">Submit my form</button>
```

#### Hidden Input

Hidden inputs provide a way to pass data to the server without displaying it to users. Hidden inputs are typically used for tracking codes, keys, or other information that is not pertinent to the user but is helpful when processing the form. This information is not displayed on the page; however, it can be found by viewing the source code of a page. It should therefore not be used for sensitive or secure information.

```html
<input type="hidden" name="tracking-code" value="abc-123">
```

#### Organizing form elements

##### Labels

Labels provide captions or headings for form controls, unambiguously tying them together and creating an accessible form for all users and assistive technologies. Created using the `<label>` element, labels should include text that describes the inputs or controls they pertain to.

Labels may include a for attribute. The value of the for attribute should be the same as the value of the id attribute on the form control the label corresponds to. Matching up the for and `id` attribute values ties the two elements together, allowing users to click on the `<label>` element to bring focus to the proper form control.

```html
<label for="username">Username</label>
<input type="text" name="username" id="username">
```

##### Fieldsets & Legends

Fieldsets group form controls and labels into organized sections. Much like a `<section>` or other structural element, the `<fieldset>` is a block-level element that wraps related elements, specifically within a `<form>` element, for better organization. Fieldsets, by default, also include a border outline, which can be modified using CSS.

A legend provides a caption, or heading, for the `<fieldset>` element. The `<legend>` element wraps text describing the form controls that fall within the fieldset. The markup should include the `<legend>`element directly after the opening `<fieldset>` tag. On the page, the legend will appear within the top left part of the fieldset border.

```html
<fieldset>
    <legend>My fieldset</legend>

    <label for="nothing">Your name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="nothing" id="nothing">
</fieldset>
```

#### Input attributes

##### Value

You can use the `value` attribute to pre-fill input fields. This can be useful when an error occurs and you want to show the user the same data again, that he typed in.

##### Disabled

The disabled Boolean attribute turns off an element or control so that it is not available for interaction or input. Elements that are disabled will not send any value to the server for form processing.

```html
<input type="text" name="nothing_else" disabled>
```

##### Placeholder

The placeholder HTML5 attribute provides a hint or tip within the form control of an `<input>` or `<textarea>` element that disappears once the control is clicked in or gains focus.

This is used to give users further information on how the form input should be filled in, for example, the email address format to use.

```html
<input type="text" name="nothing_else_matters" placeholder="your.name@example.com">
```
